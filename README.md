## 🇺🇸 English

This repository contains a simple real-time color detection project using **Python** and **OpenCV**.  
It captures video from your webcam and highlights a chosen color (e.g., blue, red, green) on screen.  

---

### 🎯 Purpose
To understand how color spaces (especially HSV) and image masks work in computer vision using OpenCV.

---

### 🧩 Structure
- `color_detection.py` — Main script for real-time color detection  
- `examples/` — Example screenshots or demo videos  
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies  

---

### ⚙️ Setup & Run

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy
2. **Run the script**
   ```bash
   python color_detection.py

---

### 📚 Technologies
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy

---

### 💡 Example Output
When you show an object of the target color (like a blue pen or red cup), the script isolates and displays only that color on the webcam feed.
